<p>
  Hello there, I'm Max S. from the United States. I'm an experienced security analyst with a focus on vulnerability management, security operations, and administration.
  <br>
  My hobbies extend from automation and security engineering (with pwsh), to racing (sim and real).
  <br>
  If you know of any way to combine both, please reach out to me!
